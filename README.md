Homework assignments for the course "CIS 198: Rust Programming" offered by the University of Pennsylvania in Spring 2016.

Due to the course's age and a desire to acquaint myself with the modern Rust ecosystem, I'll deviate from the source material in a few places (i.e. favor newer libraries and prettier code). I don't believe these changes will detract from the main thrust of the exercises, though.
